## Overview

**RepoPilot** is a native desktop application (PySide6 / Qt) that pairs autonomous AI engineering agents with your local repositories. Point it at a repo, pick an LLM, and start a conversation — or let the built-in engineer agent read, write, and refactor code on your behalf.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Multi-repo workspace** | Register multiple repositories and switch between them instantly |
| **Engineer Agent** | Autonomous coding agent that reads, edits, and creates files inside your repo |
| **Project Manager** | High-level planning agent that coordinates tasks across repositories |
| **Bring Your Own LLM** | Direct OpenAI and Anthropic keys, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic Foundry on Azure, Kimi K2, and more |
| **MCP Servers** | Extend agent capabilities with Model Context Protocol tool servers |
| **Custom Skills** | Drop in SKILL.md files to teach agents domain-specific knowledge |
| **Split-view Tabs** | VS Code-style grid layout — drag, drop, and split conversations freely |
| **Fully Local** | No cloud relay. LLM calls go directly from your machine to the provider API |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- An API key for at least one supported LLM provider such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or Azure-hosted equivalents

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url> && cd RepoPilot

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements-client.txt

# Launch
python -m client.main
```

### Quick Start

1. **Add a repository** — click **+** in the Repositories panel and select a folder.
2. **Configure an LLM** — click **+** in the LLM Clients panel and enter your OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, or other supported provider credentials.
3. **Start the engineer** — right-click the repo and choose *Start Engineer*.
4. **Chat** — ask the agent to explain, refactor, or extend your code.
